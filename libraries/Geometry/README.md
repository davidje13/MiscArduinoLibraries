# Geometry

This library contains basic geometric structures. These aim to use integer
arithmetic wherever possible, for speed and accuracy.

## Features

* 2D / 3D / 4D Vector
* 4x4 Matrix
* Quaternion
* Templated to allow any underlying type
* Designed for integer arithmetic

## Dependencies

* The FastMath library is used when generating quaternions.
  Note that the FastMath library is not public domain, but MIT licensed.
